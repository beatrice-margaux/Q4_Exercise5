	<p>Back before the invention of modern lighting, you probably would've reached for a candle or an oil lamp. If you lived in a big house, you probably needed several candles or lamps. Lighting all these devices — and keeping them lit — could be quite a chore. They could also produce a lot of heat and soot that weren't necessarily very pleasant.
	<br>
	<br>
	It's no WONDER that inventors of the past yearned for a simple solution to lighting their way in the dark. In the late 1800s, two inventors — American Thomas Edison and Englishman Sir Joseph Swan — came up with the same invention independently around the same time: the light bulb.
	<br>
	<br>
	Looking back across time, it's interesting to note that it took so long for such a simple invention to come about. The traditional light bulb, also called an incandescent light bulb, is an elegantly simple device made up of only a few basic parts. In fact, it hasn't changed much since Edison's day. It was, however, a technological revolution that forever changed history.</p>

	<h3>The Ohm's Law Equations</h3>
	<p>Ohm's Law is a formula used to calculate the relationship between voltage, current and resistance in an electrical circuit.
	<br>
	To students of electronics, Ohm's Law (E = IR) is as fundamentally important as Einstein's Relativity equation (E = mc²) is to physicists.
	<br>
	E = I x R
	<br>
	When spelled out, it means voltage = current x resistance, or volts = amps x ohms, or V = A x Ω.</p>
	<p>Calculate the amount of current (I) in a circuit, give the values of voltage (E) and resistance (R).</p>
